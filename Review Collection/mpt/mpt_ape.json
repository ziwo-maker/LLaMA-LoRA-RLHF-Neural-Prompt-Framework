However, we don't know the actual number of pages yet, so let's call it x.\n- On the second day, the reader has finished (1/8) x of the book, which is 1/8 x number of pages. Again, we don't know the actual number of pages yet, so let's call it y.\n- Therefore, we can set up two equations: 0.25x + 0.15y = 0.15x (since the reader has finished 0.15x of the book and 0.15y of the book) and 0.1x + 0.1y = 0.05x (since the reader has finished 0.1x and 0.1y of the book). \n- Solving for x and y, we get x = y and 0.05x = 0.05y. Multiplying both sides by 0.05, we get 0.025x = 0.025y. Solving for y, we get y = x/0.025. \n- Now we can substitute y = x/0.025 into the first equation: 0.15x + 0.15(x/0.025) = 0.15x.

After this, the passenger car and the goods car continue to depart, respectively, from B and A. They then meet again in D, and return to A and B respectively after a short while.

Therefore, after 1 hour (half of the total travel time), the second car will have traveled 40,000 meters (one-half of its total travel distance), while the first car will have traveled 50,000 meters (one-half of its total travel distance). After another hour, the second car will have traveled another 40,000 meters, while the first car will have traveled another 50,000 meters. This means that after 2 hours, the distance between the two cars will be 80,000 meters (one-half of the original distance), and they will meet at the midpoint of their travel.2", "The answer is 4. \nExplanation: \nLet's say the two numbers are a and b, where a is the original number and b is its expansion by a factor of 10. \nIf we multiply a and b together, we get: \na * b = a * (b + b) = a * (2b + b) = (a * 2) * b \nSo the product of a and b is the same as the product of 2a and b, as long as b remains the same. \nSince b has been expanded by a factor of 10, we can write: \nb * 10 = b + b = 2b \nSo if we multiply a and b together, we get: \na * b * 10 = a * (2b * 10) = (a * 2) * b * 10 \nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n(a * 2) * b * 10 = (a * 2) * 2b = 2a * b \nNow, we need to figure out how much to reduce b to get the original product. Since b has been expanded by a factor of 10, we can write: \n2b = 10b/10 = b \nSo if we reduce b by a factor of 10, we get: \nb * 10 = b * 10/10 = b \nSo the original product is: \na * b * 10 = 2a * b \nAnd the product of a and b after b is reduced by a factor of 10 is: \na * (b * 10/10) = a * b \nTherefore, the answer is 4.(1/10)", "\u8981\u4f7f\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e94\u8be5\u662f9\u5398\u7c73\u3002100", "To find the volume of a rectangular prism with length 8 m, width 5 m, and height?

So we can calculate the area as:\nArea = (5 x height) / 2\nWe need to find the height first.

The area of the smaller square is (side length)^2, which is 6 square centimeters. \n4. Since there are four smaller squares, the area of all four parts together is 4 x 6 = 24 square centimeters. \n5. Therefore, the area of the original square before cutting is 24 square centimeters, and the area of the resulting smaller squares is 6 square centimeters each. \n6. The area of all four smaller squares together is 6 x 4 = 24 square centimeters, which is half of the area of the original square. \n7. Therefore, the area of the resulting smaller squares is 6 square centimeters, and the area of the resulting smaller square after cutting is 6 x (side length)^2 = 36 square centimeters. \n8. Since the original square was cut into four smaller squares, the area of the resulting smaller square is 36 square centimeters, and the area of the resulting smaller square after cutting is 6 square centimeters. \n9.

We can do this by multiplying the length and width of the grassland:\nArea of square = length x width = 100 x 50 = 5000 square meters\nNext, we need to subtract the area of the square from the total area of the grassland:\nTotal area of grassland = length x width - area of square = 100 x 50 - 5000 = -5000 square meters\nFinally, we can convert the negative value to a positive value by multiplying it by -1:\nArea of grassland that does not receive water = -5000 square meters x -1 = 5000 square meters\nTherefore, the area of the grassland that does not receive water is 5000 square meters.344", "\u73b0\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u6bcf\u5929\u591a\u751f\u4ea7\u591a\u5c11\u4ef6\u73a9\u5177\uff1f\n\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\u73b0\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u6bcf\u5929\u591a\u751f\u4ea7\u591a\u5c11\u4ef6\u73a9\u5177\uff1f= 1200 - 9520 = 1040 \u4ef6\u3002160", "\u5149\u660e\u5c0f\u5b66\u53bb\u5e74\u67091600\u540d\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u4eca\u5e74\u6bd4\u53bb\u5e74\u51cf\u5c112.5%\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4eca\u5e74\u6709\u5b66\u751f\u591a\u5c11\u4eba\uff1f\u7b54\u6848\u662f1596\u4eba\u30021560", "To find the answer, we need to calculate the volumes of the two rotating bodies. Let's call the length of the longer diagonal of the triangle \"a\" and the length of the shorter diagonal \"b\". We know that a^2 + b^2 = 3^2 (since the two sides have a sum of 3), so a = sqrt(3) and b = 3/2*sqrt(3).\nWe can then use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the volume of each rotating body:\nV = \u03c0r^2h\nwhere r is the radius of the cylinder (which is half the length of the diagonal on the side of the cylinder), and h is the height of the cylinder (which is half the diagonal on the opposite side of the triangle).\nSince the longer diagonal of the triangle is the axis of rotation, we can use the length of the longer diagonal as the radius and half the length of the shorter diagonal as the height. So:\nr = a/2 = sqrt(3)/2 = 3/2*sqrt(3)\nh = b/2 = 3/2*sqrt(3)\nSubstituting these values, we get:\nV1 = \u03c0(3/2*sqrt(3))^2(3/2*sqrt(3))/2 = 18\u03c0/2\nV2 = \u03c0(3/2*sqrt(3))^2(3/2*sqrt(3))/2 = 18\u03c0/2\nSince the two rotating bodies have the same volume, their masses must be equal as well.

"To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\ntime = distance / rate\nwhere time is the time taken to travel a certain distance at a certain rate.\nFor the first part of the problem, we know that the total distance traveled by both boats in 5 hours is 30,000 + 18,000 = 48,000 miles.\nFor the second part of the problem, we know that the time taken to travel a distance of 30,000 miles at a rate of 30,000 miles per hour is 1 hour.\nSimilarly, the time taken to travel a distance of 18,000 miles at a rate of 18,000 miles per hour is 1 hour.\nTherefore, the total time taken by both boats to travel a distance of 48,000 miles in 5 hours is:\n1 hour + 1 hour + 1 hour + 1 hour + 1 hour = 5 hours\nSo, there are 5 hours of time when both boats are traveling in the same direction.(5/4)", "280 /
